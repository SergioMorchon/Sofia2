# Sofia2

[Sofia2](http://sofia2.com/) is an *IoT* plattform accesible from any kind of thing by using **middlewares** and **standards**.

This project is a free purpose of diffrent clients structured by targetted technologies (like browsers, nodejs, .NET, ...).

Because Sofia2 use **standards**, anyone can build its own client! And, of course, depllÂ¡oy it over any *thing* :)
